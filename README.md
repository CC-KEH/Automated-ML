## Introduction

Upload the dataset and get the best model in a few minutes. This is the power of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). AutoML is the process of automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems.

## Automated Machine Learning

Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. In a typical machine learning application, we need to perform the following steps:

- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Feature Selection
- Model Selection
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Evaluation
- Model Deployment

AutoML automates these steps, which makes it easier for non-experts to use machine learning models.
